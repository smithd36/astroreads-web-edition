        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">We are a <b>free</b> library of Sci-Fi books of <i>ALL AGES</i>. In fact, there are so many to sort through, we decided that this would also make a great research project.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">Recommender systems of all types use <i>Natural Language processing</i>, but there aren&apos;t many out there for science fiction enthusiasts like us.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">AstroReads contributes to research in natural language processing techniques such as &quot;document embedding&quot; with Doc2Vec and &quot;bidirectional encoder representations with transformers&quot; (BERT).</p>
